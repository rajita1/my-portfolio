Imagine a 60-inch long Sterling Silver chain that starts out as an earring and wraps around the neck in layers and layers of about 30 luxurious fuschia feathers and about 50 pink Swarovski bicones. The end of the necklace has an earring hook (42mm curved tube hoop with 1.5mm ball) that can hook to the other year or on to the necklace. For the bold sassy woman whoâ€™s not afraid to make a statement.",
